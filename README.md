# Guessing-Game-Simulation-multi-processing-application
This project is a multi-processing application that simulates a guessing game between 2 processes using signals. A parent process will create 2 children processes. Weâ€™ll
call the first child process P1 and the second child process P2.
The parent process declares the round winner by comparing the numbers picked by P1 and P2.
